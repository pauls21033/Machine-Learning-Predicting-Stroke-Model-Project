## Introduction 

According to the CDC, in 2020, 1 in 6 deaths resulted from cardiovascular disease due to stroke. In addition, according to CDC, stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the US. This dataset predicts whether an individual will be prone to suffer from a stroke contingent upon the input parameters like age, residence type, gender, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, marital status, working sector, and smoking status. The dataset provides relevant information about each individual. 

## Objective
This project is an exploratory test from the position of data analytics, in which the problem of predicting stroke in an individual is examined through machine learning. This project will consist of several steps of typical data science testing models.
