## Introduction 

According to the CDC, in 2020, 1 in 6 deaths resulted from cardiovascular disease due to stroke. In addition, according to CDC, Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the US. This dataset predicts whether an individual will be prone to suffer from a stroke contingent upon the input parameters like age, residence type, gender, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, marital status, working sector, and smoking status. The dataset provides relevant details about each individual. 

## Objective

Many stroke risk indicators are manageable, making the prognosis for stroke victims hopeful for reducing the likelihood of suffering by taking the needed actions and receiving treatment earlier. This project explores the problem of predicting stroke in an individual by examining possible stroke indicators through data & analytics and machine learning. This project uses machine learning to create a model capable of predicting Stroke results based on a dataset containing individual datapoints.
