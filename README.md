## Introduction 

According to the CDC, in 2020, 1 in 6 deaths resulted from cardiovascular disease due to stroke. In addition, according to CDC, Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the US. This dataset predicts stroke severity for patients who have suffered a stroke by examining the input parameters like age, gender, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, marital status, working sector, and smoking status. The dataset provides relevant details about each individual. 

## Objective

Many stroke risk indicators are manageable, making the prognosis for stroke victims hopeful for reducing the likelihood of suffering by taking the needed actions and receiving treatment earlier. This project explores the problem of predicting stroke risk indicators severity in an individual by examining possible stroke indicators through data & analytics and machine learning. We intend to assist medical providers in providing a prognosis for the level of recovery a patient can expect. This project uses machine learning to create a model capable of predicting Stroke results based on a dataset containing individual data points.  

## Classification Model Methods
Machine learning modeling to predict stroke severity risk indicators in patients using the **K-Nearest Neighbor** and **Random Forest** classification algorithm. This algorithm works based on existing features and similarities between these features to classify targets.
